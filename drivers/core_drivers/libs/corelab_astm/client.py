    :class:`Client` thought :class:`RecordsStateMachine` keep track
    on this order, raising :exc:`AssertionError` if it is broken.

    When `emitter` terminates with :exc:`StopIteration` or :exc:`GeneratorExit`
    exception client connection to server closing too. You may provide endless
    `emitter` by wrapping function body with ``while True: ...`` loop polling
    data from source from time to time. Note, that server may have communication
    timeouts control and may close session after some time of inactivity, so
    be sure that you're able to send whole session (started by Header record and
    ended by Terminator one) within limited time frame (commonly 10-15 sec.).
